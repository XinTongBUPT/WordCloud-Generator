China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a country in East Asia and the world's most populous country, with a population of around 1.404 billion.[10] Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the third- or fourth-largest country by total area.[k][16] Governed by the Communist Party of China, the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

China emerged as one of the world's earliest civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE.[17] Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BC until 220 AD, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass,[18] along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and Horn of Africa.[19] Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when a republic replaced the Qing dynasty. The Chinese Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949, when the Communist Party of China established the People's Republic of China, a unitary one-party sovereign state on Mainland China, while the Kuomintang-led government retreated to the island of Taiwan. The political status of Taiwan remains disputed.

Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China's economy has been one of the world's fastest-growing with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent.[20] According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017.[21] Since 2010, China has been the world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP[22] and since 2014, the largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity (PPP).[23] China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods.[24] China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army and second-largest defense budget.[25][26] The PRC is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of ASEAN Plus mechanism. China is also a leading member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), WTO, APEC, BRICS, the BCIM, and the G20. China has been widely characterized as a global superpower, rivaling the United States.

"China" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation[l] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[m][33] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Chīn (چین), which was in turn derived from Sanskrit Cīna (चीन).[38] Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahābhārata (5th century bce) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century bce).[39] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC).[40] Although this derivation is still given in various sources,[41] it is complicated by the fact that the Sanskrit word appears in pre-Qin literature. The word may have originally referred to a state such as Yelang. Later, the meaning transferred to China as a whole.[39][42] The origin of the Sanskrit word is still a matter of debate, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.[33]

The official name of the modern state is the "People's Republic of China" (Chinese: 中华人民共和国; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó). The shorter form is "China" Zhōngguó (中国), from zhōng ("central") and guó ("state"),[n] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[o] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[44] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived "barbarians".[44] The name Zhongguo is also translated as "Middle Kingdom" in English.[46]

10,000 years old pottery, Xianren Cave culture (18000–7000 bce)
Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China between 2.24 million and 250,000 years ago.[47] The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire,[48] were discovered in a cave at Zhoukoudian near Beijing; they have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago.[49] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave in Dao County, Hunan.[50] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 bce,[51] Damaidi around 6000 bce,[52] Dadiwan from 5800–5400 bce, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium bce. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium bce) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.[51]

Yinxu, the ruins of the capital of the late Shang dynasty (14th century bce)
According to Chinese tradition, the first dynasty was the Xia, which emerged around 2100 bce.[53] The dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou, Henan in 1959.[54] It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period.[55] The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records.[56] The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century bce.[57] Their oracle bone script (from c. 1500 bce)[58][59] represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found,[60] and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.[61]
